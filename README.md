# TasksManager React App

TasksManager is a simple React application designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface to add, start/stop, finish, and remove tasks. The application also tracks the time spent on each task.

See the live version [Soon... üåê](#)

## Functionalities

### Task Management
- Add new tasks with a descriptive name. The application ensures that task names are not empty.

### Start/Stop Tasks
- Easily start and stop tasks to track the time spent on them. The timer updates in real-time.

### Finish Tasks
- Mark tasks as finished when they are completed. Finished tasks are distinguishable from ongoing tasks.

### Remove Tasks
- Remove completed tasks from the list. A confirmation modal is displayed to prevent accidental removal.
